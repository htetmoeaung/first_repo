 *Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.

 * The important points about Java HashSet class are:
 * HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
 * HashSet contains unique elements only.
 * HashSet allows null value.
 * HashSet class is non synchronized.
 * HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
 * HashSet is the best approach for search operations.
 * The initial default capacity of HashSet is 16, and the load factor is 0.75.


 * Difference between List and Set
 * A list can contain duplicate elements whereas Set contains unique elements only.


 * Hierarchy of HashSet class
 * The HashSet class extends AbstractSet class which implements Set interface. The Set interface inherits Collection and Iterable interfaces in hierarchical order.


 * HashSet class declaration
 * Let's see the declaration for java.util.HashSet class.

 * public class HashSet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> implements Set<E>, Cloneable, Serializable
